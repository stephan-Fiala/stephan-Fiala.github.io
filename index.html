          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>As a resident of the DMV and a student of software development, I am fascinated by the concept of emergence. Take the broken-down bits and pieces and then build something new and unique. This ability to codify and quantize information into building new structures lets us surpass the perceived limitations of constituent elements. Much like letters and characters are rearranged into the creation of language, sonnets, and songs! With code, not only do we get to aid in communication, but in this digital world, honestly, if the sky is the limit, then why are their footprints on the moon! </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Where to start? Well, nearly 14 billion years ago, it all started, and well, to make a long story short, now we're here. Me trying to feed my numerous art passions while also spending time trying to educate myself and, of course, striving up that hill of self-improvement! I am an explorer of life, which means learning anything and everything I can. It never fails to amaze me the interconnectedness of everything. The unique experiences of everyone leads to the parallel understanding that gives rise to the spectrums that weave together in this great big ball of timey-wimey stuff!</p>
            <p>I am passoionate about web and software devolpement. I like the ability to create websites and apps that make virtual tools that can change lives. Everyone can recall websites used to stave off boredom and the maditory monotony of modern-day life. At the same time, other websites can be constructed and flow information to the user so that lives beyond the screen become irrevocably altered for the betterment of ourselves and those whom we hold dear. My willingness to work with others to gain understanding from the insights of their experiences is my favorite part of working in teams communicating, and seeing the world beyond the limits of my journey. I am interested in emergency medicine and how one day, this path and working with others may lead to the creation of websites, apps, and software that help save lives. I also like understanding the science of the very big, like astral physics, and the counterintuitive realities of the very small quantum mechanics.</p>
